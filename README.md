# Abstract

# Introduction
Accumulating evidence have suggested alterations of immune responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) play a crucial role in the detrimental progression of COVID-19. A growing number of GWASs have identified numerous significant genetic variants associated with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. Many earlier GWASs have shown that complex genetic dysregulations of peripheral immune cells with highly selective effects on the risk of immune-related diseases at the subcellular level. However, the effect of these genetic determinants on the peripheral immune cells for severe COVID-19 remains largely unknown. In light of there is no comprehensive study for revealing the genetically regulatory effects of peripheral immune cells on severe COVID-19, the present study is the first integrative genomic analysis by combining genetic information from GWAS with scRNA-seq data to genetically pinpoint immune cell types implicated in the etiology of severe COVID-19.
